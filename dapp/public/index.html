      The intimate parts of the human body which must, according to Islam, be covered by clothing. Exposing the intimate parts of the body is unlawful in Islam as the Quran instructs the covering of male and female genitals, and for adult females the breasts. Exposing them is normally considered sinful. (Wikipedia_)

      Now, notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above. It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build. Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      That's not a place to put the intimate parts. But, unlike "/logoroti.png" or "logoroti.png", "%PUBLIC_URL%/logoroti.png" will work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL, since that's not an intimate parts.
      
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Hi Mbloo!!! There is no file used as template for your feeling. But this HTML file is a template for your page not your feeling. If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page. But if you open your heart, I hope you not see an empty place.

      Mbloo, you can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file. Also to you heart, you can add any feeling there. The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag. Regarding your feeling, usually, it starts from your eyes and then descends to your heart, but not until death (dari mata lalu tidak mati_).

      Mbloo, even though it wasn't necessarily accepted by them, always express your feelings, don't hesitate! Since it's your development process. To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`. To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`. When you are sure of all that, you can tie it up with marriage. No need to doubt anymore, everything must have away. Just run the production process (beranak-pinak dan bergenerasi bangun tradisi_).
